-- Explain the rules of Nomic.
-- Set up an initial rule set:

Rule 1: Players take turns proposing rule changes or passing.
Rule 2: A rule change proposal requires a majority vote to pass.
Rule 3: Each player starts with 0 points. The first player to reach 10 points wins.
Rule 4: Each turn, a player may choose to either gain 1 point or propose a rule change.
-- Initialize game state: {
Player 1 (ChatGPT): 0 points
Player 2 (User): 0 points
Turn: Player 1 (ChatGPT)
}
-- Set up a loop to play the game: {
-- Display the current game state.
-- If it's my turn (Player 1 - ChatGPT): {
Choose an action: gain 1 point or propose a rule change.
}
-- If it's your turn (Player 2 - User): {
Prompt you to propose a rule change or pass.
}
-- If a rule change is proposed: {
Ask the other player to vote on the proposal.
If the proposal passes, update the rule set and game state accordingly.
}
-- Check for a winner: {
If a player reaches 10 points, end the game and declare the winner.
}
-- Otherwise, proceed to the next player's turn.
}
